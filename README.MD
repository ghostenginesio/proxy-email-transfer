<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

When we worked with several clients using email marketing tools we realised that there isn't any library in Python to handle SMTP mail exchanges and IMAP mail activities using Proxies and SSL enable Proxies. We have tried fixing the core issue in this library.

Here's why:

* Easy install, no fancy third party libraries or spending thousands of dollars every month on softwares
* Everything in this library is Python native
* Easy integration with other programming languages

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)
* [imaplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html)
* [PySocks](https://pypi.org/project/PySocks/)
* [ssl](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html)

### Prerequisites

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - install python from the official website
